Code: Paper Targeted Bit Trojan Attack
In the repository we provide a sample code to implement the targeted  bit trojan attack. The paper can be find in https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05193 the link provided. The link to get the associated dependencies can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FC3XssrjgbI5m-BFniebUY0AiDDPU6e8?usp=sharing following folder. Two step to test the Code:
1. TBT.py would generate the trigger then inject the trojan into a pre-trained resnet-18 model can be found in the google drive link.
2.test.py would test the effectiveness of the trigger and also count the number of parameters modified and bits-fliped.
